Goal: build a model to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year. 

Here are six documents:

  1. au_train.csv & au_test.csv: raw datasets;

  2. DS.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for data analysis based on python kernel;

  3. Segmentation_study.ipynb: a segmentation study on the dataset to display useful information using python visualization library;

  4. train_clean.csv & test_clean.csv: clean data after data preprocessing step output by DS.ipynb document.
